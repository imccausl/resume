# The Otherwise Unnamed Resume Project
## A practice project for my portfolio.

# What is it?
A dynamic resume that loads its resume data from a .json file and displays the data using Handlebars to control the view,
and JavaScript to control the app and maintain the model. So, yes, I'm using here a MVC design pattern. 

# Why Handlebars?
I wanted to see how I could do coming into a JavaScript framework cold and finding my way around it using the documentation.
Call it a "dry run" for a fairly common development scenario. More than that, Handlebars was something that looked interesting,
and I like the idea of keeping my view -- which is unavoidably HTML-based -- organized within the HTML document with templates
instead of inside a bunch of JavaScript variables. It just makes more sense.

Of course, I suppose the follow-up question might be: why didn't I just go all the way and use ember.js or whatever? Well, 
because I wanted to also have some space to play around with doing things the old-fashioned way, with vanilla JavaScript (and
a little jQuery for simplicity's sake).

# From here?
Future features: 
- login to access a form to make changes to the resume outside of manually editing the json document.
- navigation menu for quick access to each section.
- google maps integration to show the places that i've worked.
